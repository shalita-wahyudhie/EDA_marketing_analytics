### Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I do an EDA on Marketing  Analytics data with Python

Below are the findings summary:

- Data only have missing values in Income column, handled by replacing with median
- Many values in the dataset have a skewed distribution and extreme outliers. However, we only remove the records with Year_Birth outliers since it may be an error in  the data entry process. Some other outliers are excluded in the making of the plot.
- The correlation heatmap showed that poeple who made more purchase using catalog tend to spend more amount of money shopping, and people that spend more are           associated with more number of campaigns accepted.
- Higher number of web visits in the last month are associated with more deals purchases made
